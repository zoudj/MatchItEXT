\title{Compute standardized mean differences before and after matching}
\usage{
compute_smd(mi_obj, sd = "pooled")
}
\arguments{
\item{mi_obj}{A matchit object derived from MatchIt pacakge}

\item{sd}{The standard deviation used as the denominator in the formula}
}
\value{
Return a data frame containing SMD and other information
}
\description{
This function accepts a MatchIt object (i.e., the result of matchit function)
, and calculates standardized mean differences before and after matching.
Note exact matching and subclassification are not applicable to this function
. For subclassification, use compute_sub_smd() instead. In addition, SMD can
be calculated on the basis of the standard deviation of original treatment
group, which is the formula used in matchit function, or on the basis of the
simple pooled standard deviation of original treatment and control group. The
default is sd = "pooled", but it can be switched to "treatment".
}
\examples{
calculate SMD based on the simple pooled standard deviation
> \code{smd_data <- compute_smd(mi_obj, sd = "pooled")}
calculate SMD based on standard deviation of original treatment group
> \code{smd_data <- compute_smd(mi_obj, sd = "treatment")}
take lalonde data as an example
run \code{\link[MatchIt]{matchit}} to obtain the matching result (i.e., a
matchit object)
> \code{m_out <- matchit(treat ~ re74 + re75 + age + educ + hisp + black,
data = lalonde, method = "optimal")}
use matching result and \code{\link{compute_smd}} to obtain a SMD data
frame
> \code{opt_smd <- compute_smd(m_out, sd = "treatment")}
